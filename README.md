# TURTLE Quadruped Project
Written for the 2024 TURTLE QUAD V1 and Mini QUAD V1

## Getting started
To run the quadruped code, first (clone the repository)[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository]. Next, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [lsyncd](https://github.com/lsyncd/lsyncd).

This project runs in a python virtual environment to facilitate installing python dependencies. To create a virtual environment, open the repository in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the directions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments). VS Code will install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file and activate the environment in the terminal. To update python dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
